      One day before Lunar New Year, I walked into the elevator and I saw a poster for the Lunar New Year Celebration. In the corner of this poster was written loud and clear: “Poster by [insert name here].” This was before I knew 1% as much as I do now about design, and still something didn’t feel right to me.
    </br> </br>
      Another day, my colleague told me she put her initials in a logo she designed for a student group (without their knowledge) because she believed that designers should be given credits for what they design. However, (thank god!) it was tiny enough to be invisible in normal scale. This was when I knew 30-40% as much as I do now about design. Still, didn’t feel so right.
    </br> </br>
      I have been quite a shy kid since I was little. I am still shy now, just a bit less. But I think that’s the main reason why I do things behind the scenes, and I enjoy them. In school, for presentations, I would usually not present but take charge of preparing the (infamous) Powerpoint. For the podcast I’m making with a friend, I won’t talk but just prepare materials for show. In retrospect, I think this attitude is what made me fascinated in the work that goes into making something, not known to the general public, but have immense impact in how things turn out and how people behave. Now I finally know all this is called: design.
    </br> </br>
      I just love the humility of design. Designers spend days and years perfecting trivial things that 90% of the world probably don’t care about, such as the bowl of a lowercase a, or getting the perfect yellow from the printer. Designers solve others’ problems, very rarely our own. So when I see an self-centric act on a piece of design, well, it doesn’t feel so right to me. This is NOT to say that designers should not take pride on what they do, or it is inappropriate for personal expression to appear on a design work. Pride could be expressed in a multitude of ways other than writing one’s name on the work. And personal expression will inevitably come into play, even unintentionally. However, this IS to advocate the fact that designers are usually the ones to create solutions, and then step backwards to let the solutions themselves solve the problems. And how well the solutions fare proves the craft and skill of the designer. If a designer uses his or her own fame or credit to impact the problem in some way, I’m a bit in doubt, unless that person is in the league of Massimo Vignelli, Milton Glaser, and Michael Bierut (who sign their work, though very sparingly).
    </br> </br>
      For practical reasons, I don’t think designers should be too blatant about claiming credits because…what if your design is bad? Well, your name is going to stay with the ugly job for the rest of time. If the work is good and you want people to know who did it, then people will just find out and know themselves.
    </br> </br>
      Jokes aside, really, for practical reasons, the creator’s name should not be on the design we create to solve other people problems. Simply because, well, it is not about us. The famous design manifesto says “Form follows function.” If a piece of information is irrelevant to the design, it should not be there at all. Talking about his map for Berlin subway, Erik Spiekermann says it doesn’t need to say “designed by Erik Spiekermann.” The only thing he cares about is that people will get around easily thanks to the map and any change should be so well-designed to the point that the change is negligible. People just find it easier to travel around and that’s it. They don’t need to know that someone has redesigned the map.
    </br> </br>
      A person like Erik Spiekermann doesn’t care about being known for his help. He is pleased when he is able to help people and that’s simply it, he needs no more (and he really enjoys being “the unknown designer.”) Many people says Erik Spiekermann is so full of himself, but in this particular case, he is such a model for the humility and consideration anyone, not only designers, should strive for.
    </br> </br>
      Until the impossible day that I join the league of the great, I will happily take care of tiny little details, be the unknown designer, and hopefully, make someone’s life easier and a bit more fun.
