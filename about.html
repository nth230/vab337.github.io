      <h1> About the project </h1>
        <p> My Capstone topic can be prefaced with two questions: What would happen to our digital footprint when we pass away and no longer maintain this data? How would we continue our real lives when we are dead, in other words, cut ourselves off, from the Internet? As the usage of the Internet becomes more invasive in every day life, people are increasingly building more Internet personas for themselves, building more lives, leading double, triple lives on various social networks. The accumulation of all that personal information, behavior, emotions, data, and visual imagery flocks and fill up spaces in servers everywhere. Yet since these data embodies people and rely on people to inhabit, maintain, and add to them, it was fascinating for me to explore the scenario when immense amounts of data is left uncared-for, will they continue to exist or disappear? will they live in some other form? will they ever get erased from data servers at all? And there is also the other side of the equation too: the scenario when people intentionally cut themselves off from this information architectures/personas/ that they have spent time and effort building. In short, my capstone project focuses on the mortality and immortality of digital data, in relation to human life.
