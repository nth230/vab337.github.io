<div class = "textContainer">
  <p> How ‘bout them Apples? is an interactive comic strip created by Neyva Hernandez and Van Anh Bui, inspired by some of the most famous paintings in the world. We were curious about what would paintings do if they have the museum all for themselves and if they can come alive. Taking Rene Magritte’s “The Son of Man” as our protagonist, we take our readers on the journey to help the man find his apple back, so that Magritte can rest assure that the face of the man in the bowler hat will remain unknown. </p>
